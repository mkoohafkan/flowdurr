flowdurr: Flow durations in R

This package was developed as an intern working with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC). The package uses USGS streamflow data and CNRFC trace data to fit log Pearson III and 3-parameter lognormal distributions to data and generate flow duration exceedance curves. Functions for data download, cleanup, processing and visualization are included.
